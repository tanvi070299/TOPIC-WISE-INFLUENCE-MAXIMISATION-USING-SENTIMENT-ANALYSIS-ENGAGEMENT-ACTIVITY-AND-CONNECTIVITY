Consumers often form complex social networks based on a multitude of different relations and
interactions. These interactions inuence the decisions they make about adopting products or
behaviors, and hence a company could receive a large cascade of further recommendations if it
can identify and target inuential consumers. One of the basic aspects of digital marketing is
finding out such influencers who will provide good marketing to their products on social media
so that the product market grows exponentially. In our project we are contributing in finding out
those influencers on social media. Here the dataset for Twitter is considered. The purpose of our
project is to detect topic-wise influencers in social media so that we know which person or
influencer to target when marketing our product. In this project we aim at finding topic-wise
sentiment analysis by NLP, then we focus on improving its efficiency by applying a fuzzy rule
based model. Using this the influencer index of each node is calculated using four featuressentiment index, 
engagement, activity and reach. These features collectively depict the most
influential node in the particular topic.
